# Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) Inverse Kinematics Solver

Overview
This project aims to implement an inverse kinematics solver for a Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) based on two research papers:

Paper #1: "Computation of Unique Kinematic Solutions of a Spherical Parallel Manipulator with Coaxial Input Shafts" by Iliyas Tursynbek, Aibek Niyetkaliyev, Almas Shintemirov.

Despite efforts, the provided method in this paper did not yield satisfactory results for computing the inverse kinematics of the SPM.

Paper #2: "A Low-cost Open Source 3D-Printable Dexterous Anthropomorphic Robotic Hand with a Parallel Spherical Joint Wrist for Sign Languages Reproduction" by Andrea Bulgarelli, Giorgio Toscana, Ludovico Orlando Russo, Giuseppe Airo Farulla, Marco Indaco, Basilio Bona.

This paper introduces an alternative approach for a robotic hand with a parallel spherical joint wrist. Insights from this work may provide alternative strategies for implementing the SPM inverse kinematics.

Current Status
The current state of the project involves attempting to compute the inverse kinematics of the SPM using the method outlined in the first paper. However, the results are not as expected, and further investigation is required.
